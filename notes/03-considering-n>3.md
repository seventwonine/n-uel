# 03-considering-n>3

## $n=4$

We can get a general idea of player one's optimal strategy through a general consideration of possible scenarios as follows. If player one does nothing, through the 3h-uel reasoning player two has no incentive to fruit three or four. But there is no reason not to shoot one...

Probs needs to work out actual probabiltiyies for this vagueness

But generally I belive player one's best strategy may be to shoot player four in order to try to progress to a truel scenario where one is maximally likely to survive. Calculating a general 3-uel formula would be useful pre this analysis. I believe this has already been done in some papers.
